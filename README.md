PLEASE NOTE THAT I AM SAHRING A WAY TO UTILIZE AN ALREADY EXISTRING OPEN SOURCE ALGORITHM FOR FACE TRACKING DEVELOPED BY A FORMER CREATOR

Here, you can get easily download the given 2 files and run the "face-tracking.py" file that I have created

1. Download the given 2 files and save it to the locaation as you wish
2. After downloading, before you run the code, in order to properly run the program, fix the path of the "haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml" in the line 11 of the "face-tracking.py"
   For example for me, I set the file under this path to here "/home/pmt/desktop/face_tracking"
3. Save the changes
4. Run
