PLEASE NOTE THAT I AM SHARING A WAY TO UTILIZE AN ALREADY EXISTING OPEN-SOURCE ALGORITHM FOR FACE TRACKING DEVELOPED BY A FORMER CREATOR

Here, you can easily download the given 2 files and run the "face-tracking.py" file that I have created

1. Download the given 2 files and save them to the location as you wish
2. After downloading, before you run the code, in order to properly run the program, fix the path of the "haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml" in line 11 of the "face-tracking.py"
   For example, for me, I set the file under this path to here "/home/pmt/desktop/face_tracking"
3. Save the changes
4. Run
